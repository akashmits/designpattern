Advantages of the Strategy Pattern 🌟
1. Flexibility:

We can switch between different payment strategies at runtime without modifying the PaymentProcessor class. 🔄

2. Maintainability:

New payment methods can be added by simply creating new strategy classes. We don't need to touch the existing code. 🛠️

3. Separation of Concerns:

Each payment method has its own class, making the code easier to understand and maintain. 🧹

4. Extensibility:

As new payment methods become available, we can simply add them by creating new strategy classes. 💡


Real-Life Use Cases for the Strategy Pattern 🌍
• Payment Methods 💳:

Process payments via different methods like Credit Card, PayPal, Crypto, etc.

• Sorting Algorithms 📊:

Use different sorting strategies (e.g., quick sort, merge sort) depending on the situation.


• Shipping Costs 📦:

Calculate shipping costs based on various factors such as location, delivery speed, and package size.


Conclusion 🎯
#The Strategy Pattern is a powerful tool for making your code modular, flexible, and scalable.
#By encapsulating behaviors (like payment methods) into separate strategy classes, you can easily change or add new behaviors without modifying the existing code.
#This results in a cleaner, more maintainable codebase that can adapt to future requirements without significant changes
